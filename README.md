## üî® Getting Started

To get started, [clone](https://github.com/Cirrus-UI/Cirrus-Start.git) or [download](https://github.com/Cirrus-UI/Cirrus-Start/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the project.

After installing locally, open up the `cirrus-start` folder in your favorite text-editor/IDE.

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Yarn**

```sh
yarn
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

**Npm**

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Developing with cirrus-start

Make the changes you want within the project and then run locally with the following commands:

- `yarn build` - build project in `development` mode.
- `yarn watch` - build on save without live server.
- `yarn serve` - start project with live server.
- `yarn serve:hot` - build on save with live server refresh and automatically open the project on `localhost`.

For **npm**, replace `yarn` with `npm`.

After starting the project, the dev serve should be running on `http://localhost:9000`. This port number can be updated inside `webpack.config.js`.

### 3. Build for production

To create the production build of your project, run the following command:

**Yarn**

```sh
yarn build:prod
```

**Npm**

```sh
npm run build:prod
```

### 4. Deploy your project

Project deployment is powered by [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/), a fast way for developers to launch their front-end project. All projects are given a free `*.surge.sh` domain. Custom domains can be set with a paid plan.

**Yarn**

```sh
yarn deploy
```

**Npm**

```sh
npm deploy
```

Simply follow the prompts after entering the above command.

### 5. Redeploy your project

To update your existing deployment, use the `redeploy` command and specify the domain you used.


```sh
yarn deploy my-project.surge.sh
```

**Npm**

```sh
npm deploy my-project.surge.sh
```

### 6. Teardown your project

Once you no longer need it deployed, use the `teardown` comand to remove your project's deployment.

```sh
yarn teardown
```

**Npm**

```sh
npm teardown
```
